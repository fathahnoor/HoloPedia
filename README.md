# HoloPedia

## Project Description
[HoloPedia](https://github.com/fathahnoor/HoloPedia/) is a [Mixed Reality](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality) based Wikipedia-like system. Our system consists of a [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) application, which receives speech input from its user, that will automatically (using Machine Learning) combine information from existing [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and its related 3D models (grabbed from free 3D models repository sites). The user then can view those Holographic models and its information in their physical environment using HoloLens.

## Required Tools
